                        <p style="text-align:justify;">The undersigned International Teachers from India would like to bring it to your kind notice the following issues faced by them in USA. <br><br>
                        Several of us are teaching the critical needs subject areas like Mathematics, Special Education, and Sciences at different grade levels mostly in Public Schools of remote counties in different states of USA. We are working mostly on H1B work visas. Mostly the schools we are currently working are title-I schools. The students belong to high poverty and low socio-economic groups of the society. These are mostly low achieving schools with severe shortage of highly qualified teachers in critical need subject areas as Mathematics, Sciences, Special Education etc. These jobs are hard to fill jobs for various reasons. We are teaching in those schools for a very long time. Some of us even spent more than 10 years teaching in these schools, making a difference in the life of students, and helping the test scores go up, thus improving the graduation percentage of schools.<br><br>
                        Some of our teachers have been elected as either ‘Teacher of the Year’ or ‘District Teacher of the Year’ apart from other recognitions, from various school districts in different states of USA. Our teachers, are being loved and respected by the school administrators, staff, students and the community as well. We are all very hard working community of teachers. We are very dedicated to the profession and to the future of America.  <br><br>
                        Since our spouses who are on H4 visas are not entitled to work until we started Green Card process and cleared either I-140 stage and put up 6 years under H1B visa. They are very small in numbers. Teacher salaries are not any way close compared to the Information Technology or any other professionals who work under the same H1B visa (highly skilled work visa) category. Because of this discrepancy, we are facing lot of difficulties in educating our own children after they complete high school. The college education as you know is very expensive. Our children are not eligible for any scholarships for not being either Green Card holders or Citizens. Paying the college fee for our children in entirety is causing a huge burden on us, forcing some of us to send the children back to India for their further education. Many of our children who are high achieving students are disappointed, demotivated, and settling for less, for not being eligible for any scholarships to pursue the education they have aimed at. In some cases, they have to pay out of state tuition fee, which is very high and unaffordable for us.<br><br>
                        Hence, we all kindly request your office to take up this issue at your level and represent our case to treat us as a special group under Green Card category. We also request you to kindly, make amendments if necessary and make our children eligible for college scholarships on par with the American citizens.

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
